# Swift Pomodoro Timer
A simple and user-friendly Pomodoro timer implemented in Swift using SwiftUI. 

This application helps users manage their time more effectively by breaking it down into focused intervals (25 minutes by default) separated by short breaks (5 minutes by default). 

After every fourth interval, a longer break (15 minutes).
